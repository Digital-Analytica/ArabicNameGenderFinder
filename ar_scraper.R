# This program parses html files which were downloaded from this website
# for masculine names (http://www.childclinic.net/names/first_name_boys.html),
# and this for feminine (http://www.childclinic.net/pain/girls.html)
# The html files contain arabic names written in arabic letters (as opposed
# to english). The files are in the "ar_html_files" directory and were
# downloaded using a simple R program which basically used the download.file
# function. The program genderFinder.R should be used to query the csv files for
# someone's gender based on their first name.
